# Introduction  

The **CICIDS2017 dataset** is a comprehensive collection of network traffic data, designed for evaluating intrusion detection systems (IDS). This notebook focuses on preparing the dataset for machine learning (ML) models by implementing a thorough data cleaning and transformation pipeline.  

The initial analysis involved exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover the dataset's structure and key characteristics. Building on these insights, this notebook ensures the dataset is ready for effective model training and evaluation by addressing issues such as data inconsistencies, scaling requirements, and output preparation.  

### Objectives of This Notebook:
1. **Data Cleaning**:  
   - Handle missing values through removal or imputation.  
   - Eliminate duplicates and correct inconsistencies to maintain data quality.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
   - Visualize and analyze the dataset to identify patterns, outliers, and correlations.  

3. **Data Scaling**:  
   - Standardize features to a uniform scale, critical for distance-based models like KNN and SVM.  

4. **Dataset Preparation for Modeling**:  
   - Save two processed datasets to cater to different modeling needs:  
     - A **cleaned dataset** for baseline model training.  
     - A **scaled dataset** optimized for distance-based algorithms.  

This pipeline ensures the CICIDS2017 dataset is refined and transformed for robust machine learning experiments.
