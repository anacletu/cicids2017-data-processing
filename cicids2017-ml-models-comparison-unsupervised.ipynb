It builds upon the preprocessed CICIDS2017 dataset, prepared in the **data preprocessing [notebook available here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ericanacletoribeiro/cicids2017-comprehensive-data-processing-for-ml)** and continuous the performance analysis started on the **[supervised learning notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ericanacletoribeiro/cicids2017-ml-models-comparison-supervised)**. \n","\n","The broader goal is to develop a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) prototype capable of identifying a range of network attacks, such as DoS, PortScan, and Brute Force, while balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. This is particularly critical in resource-constrained environments, focus of the project. The complete pipeline is **documented on [Github](https://github.com/anacletu/ml-intrusion-detection-cicids2017)**.\n","\n","**Models Being Evaluated:**\n","\n","* **Supervised Learning ([Previous Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ericanacletoribeiro/cicids2017-ml-models-comparison-supervised)):**\n","    * Random Forest\n","    * XGBoost\n","    * Logisc Regression\n","\n","* **Unsupervised Learning (This Notebook):**\n","    * Isolation Forest\n","    * Mini-Batch KMeans\n","    * Autoencoders\n","\n","**Evaluation Strategy:**\n","\n","The models are assessed using k-fold cross-validation on the training data, with a separate hold-out test set reserved for final evaluation. Key performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and resource usage (CPU time and memory consumption). These metrics provide critical insights into algorithm efficiency and effectiveness, essential for real-time deployment in resource-constrained networks.\n","\n","This notebook presents the training process, hyperparameter tuning, and comparative analysis of the selected unsupervised learning models."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a22d7a86","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001688,"end_time":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.720439","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.718751","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Helper Functions"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"3ce60ff8","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.725514Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.725153Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.731132Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.729939Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.010878,"end_time":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.733125","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.722247","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["# TO DO"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8272f58d","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.001654,"end_time":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.736859","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-01-14T16:11:03.735205","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# 2.
