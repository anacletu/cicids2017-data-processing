It builds upon the preprocessed CICIDS2017 dataset, prepared in the **data preprocessing [notebook available here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ericanacletoribeiro/cicids2017-comprehensive-data-processing-for-ml)** and continuous the performance analysis started on the **[supervised learning notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ericanacletoribeiro/cicids2017-ml-models-comparison-supervised)**. \n","\n","The broader goal is to develop a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) prototype capable of identifying a range of network attacks, such as DoS, PortScan, and Brute Force, while balancing detection accuracy with computational efficiency. This is particularly critical in resource-constrained environments, focus of the project.
